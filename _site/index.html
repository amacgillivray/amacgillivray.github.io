<h1 id="hi-im-andrew">Hi, I’m Andrew</h1>
<p>This blog is where I post about my programming experiences and other topics that catch my interest. It also contains a list of <a href="/publications">my publications</a>. The blog runs on a custom Jekyll theme I’m developing, called “<a href="https://github.com/amacgillivray/baltic">Baltic</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="more-about-me">More about me</h2>
<p>I’ve been working as a software developer since I was 18 (going back to school for a BS-CS at 21). I primarily work with C++, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. However, I’ve done smaller projects with a wide variety of languages including Rust, C, Haskell, Python, R, COBOL, and IBM ILE languages (DDS, RPG, CL), among others.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, browsing hacker news, watching Formula 1, and frequenting my local Cars and Coffee events.</p>
