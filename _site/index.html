<h1 id="hi-im-andrew">Hi, I’m Andrew</h1>
<p>This blog is where I post about my programming experiences and other topics that catch my interest. It also contains a list of <a href="/publications">my publications</a>. It runs on a custom Nord-IDE-based theme I’m developing, called “<a href="https://github.com/amacgillivray/baltic">Baltic</a>”.</p>

<p>I’ve been a little busy lately, so it’s taken longer than intended to get it up and running. In the meantime, I <em>have</em> published <a href="https://gist.github.com/amacgillivray">a few gists</a> that are similar to what I plan to post here. For a good example, check out my post on <a href="https://gist.github.com/amacgillivray/c37a2a860df5117561ec64604bcb6b7d">computing large perfect numbers using Haskell</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My Background</h2>
<p>I’ve been working as a software developer since I was 18 (later going back to school for a BS CS). I primarily work with C++, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. However, I’ve done smaller projects with a wide variety of languages including Rust, C, Haskell, Python, R, COBOL, and IBM ILE languages (DDS, RPG, CL), among others.</p>

<p>At work, I’ve led several major projects including a time tracking system (currently developing) and a purchase order system (first deployed in 2019, in daily use since). Both incorporate directly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infor_XA">MAPICS</a>, running in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=programming-pase-i">PASE</a> on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-i">IBM i Series</a>. I also developed about 10 unique websites for Butler, most recently <a href="https://bncsme.com/">bncsme.com</a> and a redesign of <a href="https://butlernational.com/">butlernational.com</a>, and a few small windows desktop applications (Visual C++).</p>

<p>In school (BS CS ‘23), to put it simply, I did a lot. Living 45 miles off campus, I did as much as possible to stay involved, which meant constantly drawing triangles on the map between Overland Park (home), Olathe / the New Century AirCenter (work), and Lawrence (KU).</p>

<p>I was a very active member of Dr. Esam El-Araby’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/esam-el-araby/research-group/member-biographies">KUARQ research team</a>, co-authoring 7 publications on Quantum Computing and HPC. I did graphic design, photography, and video for our FSAE team, <a href="https://www.jayhawkmotorsports.org/2022team">Jayhawk Motorsports</a>. <!-- I was an active member, and later vice president, of the student organization for *my* preferred political party; I was also dedicated [Dole SAB](https://doleinstitute.org/ku-students/student-advisory-board/) member, where I quickly became friends with the most active students from the *other* big political party. I founded and ran one of [the more active student clubs](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/s2aa) on campus (and led its biggest event, hosting [Stop the Bleed](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/event/9013015) with Stormont Vail Hospital).--> I was interested in community service and became a regular attendee of the Dole Institute, volunteering with their Student Advisory Board and serving as vice president of a related student organization. I also organized a number of community events, including an on-campus “Stop the Bleed” first-aid education event with the Stormont Vail Hospital. Less frequently, I could be found at KU Car Club and KU AI Organization events (I later led an IEEE competition entry with the latter).</p>

<p>These days, I spend my spare time hiking, finding <a href="https://gist.github.com/amacgillivray/5adfeb70a194e0c458d4f54f2f3bbd87">creative solutions</a> to LeetCode problems, browsing hacker news, and frequenting my local Cars and Coffee events.</p>
