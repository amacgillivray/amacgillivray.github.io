# Hi, I'm Andrew
This blog is where I post about my programming experiences and other topics that catch my interest. It also contains a list of [my publications](/publications). The blog runs on a custom Jekyll theme I'm developing, called "[Baltic](https://github.com/amacgillivray/baltic)".

## More about me
I've been working as a software developer since I was 18 (going back to school for a BS-CS at 21). I primarily work with C++, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. However, I've done smaller projects with a wide variety of languages including Rust, C, Haskell, Python, R, COBOL, and IBM ILE languages (DDS, RPG, CL), among others.

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, browsing hacker news, watching Formula 1, and frequenting my local Cars and Coffee events.
